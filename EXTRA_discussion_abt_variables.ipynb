    "\n",
    "For example, volume weighted average price and all moving averages can be derrived from the time and sales. Therefore, we will go back through our list of variables and group them together based on if they are derrivatives of each other, which will make it more clear as to which data we need find out in the web.

    "- Full Level 2: We don't want to rely only on orders that have gone through; it is not the full picture. We also need to account for all of the orders that were PUT OUT THERE, filled or not. These orders are visually represented to traders via the Level 2 board, which shows the price on the bid and ask, the number of shares available, and the exchange. The orders are stacked on top of each other and seperated based on who placed the order. The same person can place multiple orders on different exchanges. \n",
    "    - Often, the stock price is manipulated using the Level 2. They may place a large order on the Ask, making other sellers want to front-run that order by placing sell orders at a cheaper price than where that large order is at. All the while the large seller has bids at a lower price since they wanted to long the stock in the first place. The seller puts a bit sell order out so that the price moves down and fills them on a better price lower. Once their buy orders get filled, they remove their large sell order, and the price naturally trends back to the upside.\n",
    "    - So we need to account for the bids/asks. Maybe not ALL of them, but at least the bids and asks that are a certain distance away from price at any given time. So if the price is at $15, we will include all of the bids and asks from $12 to $18, or if the Average True Range is high, then from $9 to $20.... \n",
    "        - We actually want to include all of them, becauase for cheaper stocks, they may double in price, so if we set our algo to only capture bids/asks at a percentage away from the price that is less that %100, then we will miss out on the rest of the critical information. \n",
    "    - *This idea leads me to think that it is a good idea to create different algorithms. One algorithm that trades cheap stocks that move crazily and can double or even triple.

    "The first part of data we need is: Time and Sales. The time and sales are shown to traders as rows of data flowing downward like a water fall. This 'water fall' is refered to as the \"tape\" my most traders. As a new order is executed, it is added to the very top of the tape assuming that we it sorted by time. \n",

For example, my tape is colored green when the trades are executing at the ASK, meaning that buyers are in control, and when the sellers are hitting the BID my tape will show red for each execution that is on the ask. This is something that a bot will not need. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also don't use all of these indicators on my tape. For example, I don't inlcude time on my tape because I don't have the brain power to be able to factor time into my trading decisions; I would be difficult/impossible for me to calculate fluctuations in the differences between the time of each execution, and then use those calculations to add to my trading decision. It would be particularily difficult when the tape is moving so fast that it is 'skipping', where large order blocks come in so fast that the 'waterfall' starts to look more like a 'flashing screen' of changing orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bot, however, should be able to monitor the time difference fluxuations, and similar cases of variables that a human simply does not have enough brain power/time to compute. This idea is essentially the basis of the project.\n",
